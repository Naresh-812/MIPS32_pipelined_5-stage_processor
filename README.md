# ðŸ§  MIPS32 5-Stage Pipelined Processor

This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor in Verilog HDL, supporting Register-type (R-type), Immediate-type (I-type), and Jump-type (J-type) instructions. The processor adheres to the classic 5-stage MIPS pipeline architecture:

1. **IF** â€“ Instruction Fetch
2. **ID** â€“ Instruction Decode & Register Fetch
3. **EX** â€“ Execute / Address Calculation
4. **MEM** â€“ Memory Access
5. **WB** â€“ Write Back

## ðŸ”§ Features

* âœ… 32-bit instruction support (MIPS32 ISA)
* âœ… R-type, I-type, and J-type instruction execution
* âœ… Hazard detection and basic forwarding logic
* âœ… Pipeline register implementation between all stages
* âœ… Support for arithmetic, logic, memory, and branch instructions
* âœ… Parameterized instruction and data memory
* âœ… Synthesizable and testbench-verified

### R-Type:

* `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`

### I-Type:

* `addi`, `andi`, `ori`, `lw`, `sw`, `beq`, `bne`

### J-Type:

* `j`, `jal`

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

* Full forwarding unit to eliminate all stalls
* Branch prediction
* Exception/Interrupt handling
* Support for more instructions (e.g., shift, multiplication, division)
